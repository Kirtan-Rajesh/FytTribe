# FytTribe
We are building **FytTribe**, a mobile-first platform that connects individuals into group sports sessions, events, and social gatherings. Our goal is to make it effortless for users—especially in India—to discover, join, and organize community-driven athletic and recreational activities. By combining AI-powered matching, real-time coordination tools, and integrated venue booking, we aim to transform how people find teammates, stay active, and build lasting friendships.

## What We’re Building  
### 1. AI-Driven Group Matching  
We’ll develop algorithms that analyze user interests, skill levels, availability, and location to suggest ideal “playpals” or groups for various sports and activitiesciteturn1search0. This goes beyond simple filters by leveraging machine-learning techniques to optimize team balance and user satisfactionciteturn1search1.  

### 2. Event & Venue Management  
Users can create public or private sessions—ranging from casual pick-up games to structured tournaments—with automated RSVPs, reminders, and integrated venue booking through third-party APIs (e.g., local sports facilities)citeturn1search2. Payment processing for paid events will be handled via Razorpay or Stripe integrationsciteturn1search3.  

### 3. In-App Communication & Coordination  
A built-in chat and notification system will enable seamless coordination: group announcements, last-minute lineup changes, and location sharing. Push notifications and calendar sync ensure users never miss a matchciteturn1search4.  

### 4. Community Ratings & Analytics  
Participants can rate each other, coaches, and venues to build trust and quality control. Basic performance metrics (attendance streaks, win-loss records) give users insights into their activity patterns and encourage engagementciteturn1search5.

## Why We’re Building This  
### Addressing Fragmented Discovery  
In India, sports enthusiasts often struggle to find reliable, local groups or suitable venues for playciteturn1search6. Existing solutions are either too generic (Meetup) or lack integrated booking and AI matching (Playo)citeturn1search7.  

### Fostering Community & Well-Being  
Group sports drive both physical health and social bonds. By simplifying group formation, we help combat sedentary lifestyles and social isolation, particularly in urban centersciteturn1search8.  

### Market Opportunity  
The Indian sports-app market is growing at a 15.2% CAGR, projected to reach USD 614 million by 2030citeturn1search9. With rising smartphone penetration and a youthful population, there’s a clear demand for streamlined, community-focused sports platformsciteturn1search10.
